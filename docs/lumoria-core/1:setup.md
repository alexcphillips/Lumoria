# Getting Started

These are the steps to get the API running on your machine.

- **Node.js** – lets us run JavaScript outside of the browser.  
  [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

- **Docker** – ensures the app runs the same way on any machine without having to install _everything_ manually.

### Step 1: Navigate to the project

Use `cd` to get into the project directory.  
If your code is in a `/code` folder, it might be something like:

```shell
cd ~/code/Lumoria
```

### Step 2: Run the app

```shell
./scripts/start-local:core
```
